/**
 * A square of squares
 * <p>
 * You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
 * <p>
 * However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
 * <p>
 * Task
 * <p>
 * Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
 * <p>
 * In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
 * The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
 * <p>
 * Examples
 * <p>
 * Square.isSquare(-1) // => false
 * Square.isSquare( 3) // => false
 * Square.isSquare( 4) // => true
 * Square.isSquare(25) // => true
 * Square.isSquare(26) // => false
